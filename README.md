The task aimed to evaluate condition monitoring of hydraulic system and provide training and tuning based on the given dataset for reliable predictions about expected maintenance of each valves and other parameters through supervised learning.

A DFNN network was built for the system to train itself to predict the correct outcomes of the system based on different conditions or factors.
